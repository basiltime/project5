Project 5: Build an E-Commerce Site
===========================

The goal of the project is to use an API to retrieve and send data to an existing backend.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Site Structure:
---------------

* A list view page, showing all items available for sale. 
* A single product page (using URL query parameters), which will dynamically show the item selected by the user, display a description and price in dollars, and allow users to personalize the product and add it to their cart. 
* A cart page (using the localStorage JavaScript functionality), showing a summary of products in the cart, the total price, and a form with which to submit an order.
* An order confirmation page , thanking the user for their order, showing the total price and the order ID returned by the server.

How to use the site:
--------------------

You will have to have `node` and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

Clone this repository:

https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5

Rename the directory to `backend`. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. Then, run `node server` in the backend directory. The server should run on `localhost` with default port 3000. 

Now, go to https://basiltime.github.io/project5/ to go use the site.
